# file_server

This is a web application for the Amali pre-selection training program. The assignment was to build a file server with various functionalities.
I have written this web app to interact with the server and demo its features.

## Link to the app
I have hosted the app on Netlify and the link to it is https://668e82760149941ca8e9323f--vocal-daifuku-9ec2ea.netlify.app
